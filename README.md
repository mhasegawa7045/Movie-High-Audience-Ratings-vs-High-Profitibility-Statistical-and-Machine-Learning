# Movie-High-Audience-Ratings-vs-High-Profitibility-Statistical-and-Machine-Learning

The box office industry is one of the biggest global markets in the entertainment industry. According to *IMDbPro*,the industry has a yearly average box office revenue of around 11 to 14 million dollars and a yearly total gross of around 9 to 12 billion dollars. The project wants to determine what makes a Hollywood movie have a high `Profitability` and what makes it have a high `AudienceScore`, and how `Profitability` and `AudienceScore` correlate with each other. Movie studios would find this information resourceful since it could help them determine the best kind of movies that will lead to larger profits and more positive feedback on their movies for better publicity.

This will be done with EDA, K-means clustering, decision trees, bagging, boosting, and random forests that will help determine the pattern for high-earning and higly-rated movies. This project will be done in RStudio and RCloud with the dataset, `HollywoodMovies`, provided by Dr. Reinaldo Sanchez-Arias.
